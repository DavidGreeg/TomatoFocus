// Functionalities:

//   • Checkbox to activate/deactivate longbreak arguments.
//   • Description: after every N completed work blocks,
//                  inserts a long break instead of a short one.
//   • Sounds: 
//     - Play "break" and then "longbreak", distinguish in notification title.
//     - Added 'playSeq' function in 'service_worker' to play both sounds.
